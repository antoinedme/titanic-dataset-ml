# Titanic dataset discovery
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters. 
After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, before heading west to New York. On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol for loading lifeboats. At 2:20 a.m., she broke apart and foundered with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.

The dataset has 1309 entries. 
This dataset describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The dataset has 12 variables:
- `name` (to be replaced by id)
- `survived`: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
- `pclass`: Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
- Demographics: `Sex`, `Age`
- `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- `ticket`: Passenger ticket number
- `fare`: Passenger fare
- `cabin`: Cabin number
- `embarked`: Port of embarkation; C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

It is the beginning of my data science journey!
